# Easy Install

You just type `bash install-xx.sh` and we do the rest.

## Example
**Install caffe:**
```bash
cd ~/ && git clone git@github.com:zeakey/ez-install
bash ~/ez-install/install-caffe.sh
```

*There are alternative links for CN:cn: users to accelerate download due to some special reasons.*

Any problem, don't hesitate to create an [Issue](https://github.com/zeakey/ez-install/issues).
